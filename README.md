# Training_Word2Vec_Embbeddings_for_ISNA_News
In this repository, I trained the embedding of words (Word2Vec embeddings) using the Isna news corpus, "PERSICA". The "PERSICA" corpus includes news ID, title, text, date, publication time, and the news label. It can be used for several NLP tasks like news classification, topic discovery and classification, category classification, and many more procedures.
The dataset is an open-source corpus that can be downloaded from the address (https://sourceforge.net/projects/persica/files/persica.csv/download)
In the Notebook code I provided, I wrote what should be done to teach word vectors, step by step as follows:
The body of this Notebook code which was written in the Colab environment, consists of the following 7 headings:
